# Clean-Energy-Outlook
This is where we examine and map the clean world!

### License Choice
We chose MIT License since is a permissive license that is short and to the point. It lets people do anything they want with our code as long as they provide attribution back to us and don’t hold our liable.

### Directory Structure
We divide our directory into four parts: data, code, results and maps.  
We plan to store all our data (both inputs and outputs) in data directory, then all the codes for the software we design in code directory. Meanwhile, after the work of machine learning the results would be collected and put into the results directory. Based on those prior work, maps directory would be for our visiualization outcome.

Here is a simple tree plot of the current structure:
```
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── code
├── data
│   ├── HYTCP
│   │   ├── inputs
│   │   └── outputs
│   ├── NUETP
│   │   ├── inputs
│   │   └── outputs
│   ├── SOEGP

│   └── WYTCP
