Description: 
        Clean-Energy-Outlook
        ====================
        Clean Energy Outlook is a software that reads in energy generation data from
        1960 to 2014 of various states of the United States as well as other data like
        GDP, climate, oil price, and other factors and predicts the renewable energy
        generation of each state for the next 5 years. Software will be useful for
        investors and policy makers in renewable energy. Investors in clean energy can
        use this software to identify states where clean energy has high potential.
        Policy makers can also use this software to develop clean energy policies for
        different states.
