### 1. Predict Energy Outlook for a State in the United States
**Use Case Name:**   
Predict Energy Outlook for a State in the United States  
**Description:**   
Predict Energy Outlook for a State in the United States using past 50 years data.  
**Actors:**   
User (Primary)  
**Assumptions:**  
**Steps:**  
* User selects state from the map of the United States  
* The energy outlook of the state is displayed  

**Issues:**  
How to implement?  

### 2. optimization of local energy structure.  
**Use Case Name:**  
optimization of local energy structure.  
**Description:**  
according to the cost and developing trend of different energy type, give advice to investors, Helpful for the future plan of clean energy investment within different states.  
**Actors:**  
User (Primary)  
**Assumptions:**  
**Steps:**  
* calculate the cost of the four energy type
* compare the cost and come to conclusion  

**Issues:**  


### Combine to one user case
###
**Use Case Name:**  
Clean energy(photovoltaic) industry outlook and energy source structure optimization  

**Description:**   
Using the energy sector information from the last 50 years, predict the market and need for solar energy in near future for a specific state.  

**Actors:**     
User input request a state   

**Assumptions:**  
* For one state, the total energy consumption over the years will increase. The energy supplied by traditional energy source and clean energy source will also increase.  
* A greater increase in areas favorable for solar energy and during time when solar cell development is popular.  
* The future of certain clean energy type(solar energy) may or may not be suitable for a specific state due to above reasons.  

**Steps:**  
* Base on the trend of different energy sectors(both clean and traditional) within a state, predict the demand and feasibility of solar energy development in the next 10 years.  
* When user asks for a specific state, shows the data prediction and visualization.  
* With predictions for all states, generate an overall outlook of this type of clean energy in America.  

**Issues:**  
* How much weight does each factor has on the future of this clean energy?
